# Catalog

Machines published from their own repositories reach the Open-XY builder
through [`catalog/machines.json`](../catalog/machines.json). The catalog pins
one tagged commit of each; nothing is copied into this repository. Each
machine's ID is held for good, so no two machines ever share one. Engine,
effect and page numbers are not the catalog's: each firmware's
[layout](api.md#identity) gives them. Authors follow the
[submission guide](https://github.com/etcetc000/open-xy-machine-template/blob/main/SUBMITTING.md).

## Entries

```json
{"id": "karplus", "kind": "synth", "maintainer": "etcetc000", "status": "published",
 "repository": "https://github.com/etcetc000/open-xy-karplus", "tag": "v1.3.0",
 "commit": "617e321f8037541f283cfe46fd39ff90d5e9db8c", "path": "."}
```

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `id`, `kind` | As in the machine's `definition.json` and `machine.json` ([identity rules](api.md#identity)) |
| `maintainer` | The GitHub user who maintains it |
| `status` | `reserved`: the ID is held for a machine being written. `published`: built from its release. `retired`: no longer built; its ID stays held |
| `repository`, `tag`, `commit`, `path` | A published machine's release: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>`, the tag, its full commit SHA, and the machine's folder in the repository (`.` at the root). A retired entry may keep them |

IDs are unique across the catalog and the bundled machines.

Each published synth or sample machine must commit a valid
[`presets/default.json`](api.md#default-preset) beneath its `path`. Fetching checks
it from the same pinned commit as the code; the builder embeds it and installs
it under `content/presets/<id>/default.json`. One repository can hold several
machines, each with its own catalog entry, folder and default. Send effects use
definition defaults and do not install an instrument preset.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `python sdk.py catalog check [--base <ref>] [--allow-control-changes]` | Validates the catalog against itself and the bundled machines. With `--base`, also against an earlier catalog: every entry stays, with its kind, and its status only moves forward; a published machine whose commit moved is fetched at both commits and its [controls compared](#controls) |
| `python sdk.py catalog fetch [--tags]` | Fetches every published machine at exactly its commit into `local/catalog/`, checks it matches its entry and writes `local/catalog/collection.json`: the bundled machines, then every published one. `--tags` also confirms each tag still names its commit |
| `python sdk.py catalog test [--tags]` | Fetches, then runs [`sdk.py test`](first-machine.md#what-you-own) on every published machine |

A fetched folder that changed is refused; delete it to fetch again. Pass the
collection to any build command:

```sh
python sdk.py compile --collection local/catalog/collection.json --out <folder>
```

## Pull requests

The [Catalog workflow](../.github/workflows/catalog.yml) runs on every pull
request that changes `catalog/` or anything published machines build against
(the SDK, tooling, profiles, linker script or bundled machines). It validates the catalog, fetches each
published machine and checks it as its own repository's CI does, and compiles
the firmware module with the bundled machines and all published ones on the
pinned Windows tools.

Merged catalog changes reach the site with the next release
([`sdk.py release`](builder.md#cloudflare-deployment)): beta from `staging`,
then production from `main`.

A maintainer then reviews a new machine once, in full:

- It uses only the public headers: no assembly, raw addresses or platform code.
- Its audio callbacks never allocate, block, log or do I/O.
- Its name is sensible, and its licence allows redistribution.
- It sounds right in the browser preview from its CI.
- Its committed default preset provides the intended starting sound.

An update moves `tag` and `commit` and is reviewed as a diff. The workflow
compares the catalog with the pull request's target branch: a change of `kind`
is refused, and a removed machine becomes `retired`, never deleted.
A new `repository` or `maintainer` is a handover: it fails the check, and a
catalog maintainer approves it in a pull request of its own.

### Controls

Projects save a machine's parameter values by index in its `definition.json`
`parameters`, so an update keeps what each saved value means. Compared with
the previous release, each parameter keeps its index, `id`, `mapping` and, for
an alternate, `control`. A removed, moved or renamed parameter, or a changed
mapping (its kind, range, values or enum labels), fails the check, which names
each by index. Parameters added after the last one and new `label`, `display`
or `default` values are reported and allowed.

A catalog maintainer approves a control change by adding the
`controls-changed` label to the pull request; the workflow runs again and
passes `--allow-control-changes`.
